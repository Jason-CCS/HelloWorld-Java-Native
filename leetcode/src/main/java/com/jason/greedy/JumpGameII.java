/**
 * Problem: 45
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * The JumpGameII class calculates the minimal number of jumps to reach the end of a given array.
 * <p>
 * Greedy algorithms follow a simple problem-solving heuristic which is to make the choice that
 * looks best at the current moment, with the hope that by choosing the best option now, youâ€™ll get
 * an overall optimal solution to the problem.
 * <p>
 * Characteristics of Greedy Algorithms
 * <p>
 * 1. Greedy choice property: A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum.
 * 2. Optimal substructure: A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to
 * the problem contains an optimal solution to subproblems.

     * The key here is it uses two variables to save the latest greedy value.
     * One is nextMaxDistance, the other is currentMaxDistance.
     * When i reaches currentMaxDistance, it means it reaches last time the most max distance where we can reach.
     * And once we reach, we will see what is the next max distance that we can go.
     * The next max distance might be updated by any of the former index of the current index, so this means the better
     * way to go further is from that former index, but not from the current index.
     * <br>
     * Anyway, using two variables to save the latest greedy values is the way that I have never thought of.
     * Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array 'nums'.
     *
     * @param nums The input array containing non-negative integers.
     * @return The minimum number of jumps from the first position to the last in nums.
